- nodeJS

Installation
==============

navigate to the root directory of this project with a terminal then give the command 

```bash
npm install
```

this should do all the setup

Running the server
======================

```bash
npm run dev
```

will start serving to port 8000

```bash
npm start
```

will try to run on port 80 *howerver* this will most likely require 

```bash
sudo npm start
```

because that port requires privilages to bind to on most machines
